## Asking Questions

We have an IRC chat channel on freenode.net. The channel name is `#cothings`.
Feel free to join and ask your questions. Or you can send us an email at <info@cothings.app>

## Reporting Security Issues

We take  security seriously. If you discover a security issue, please bring it to our attention right away!

Please **DO NOT** file a public issue,
instead send your report privately to us via [email](mailto:info@cothings.app?subject=Security%20Issue).
This will help ensure that any vulnerabilities that _are_ found
can be [disclosed responsibly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure)
to any affected parties.

## Reporting Other Issues

A great way to contribute to the project
is to send a detailed issue when you encounter a problem.
We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report.

Check that the project issues database
doesn't already include that problem or suggestion before submitting an issue.
If you find a match, add a quick "+1" or "I have this problem too."
Doing this helps prioritize the most common problems and requests.

When reporting issues, please include the following:

* The version of Xcode you're using
* The version of iOS you're targeting
* The full output of any stack trace or compiler error
* A code snippet that reproduces the described behavior, if applicable
* Any other details that would be useful in understanding the problem

This information will help us review and fix your issue faster.

## Opening Pull Requests

We respect the contributors' labor more than anything, so, we would like to confirm your contributions are made by the true person through your public GPG Key that validates your full name and email address.

**Pull Requests will be merged only after they are signed with valid GPG signatures from the author.**

Please add your full name and email into the top of the file you're coding. This is need when release the version without `.git` history. Archives don't include  `.git` folder. So, your contributions always will be visible and public.

```
//

After your contribution has done, please make sure that you've added your name in the Contributors section of the project's [README](readme.md#Contributors) with a signed commit, as a part of the pull request.
